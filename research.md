# My Research 
The article I chose to refer my goal to is "SAGE Handbook of Research on Classroom Assessment" edited by James H. Mcmillan. This article talks about classroom assessment techniques. My goals that I talk about in this assignment overall show my strive to succeed even with times where I fail. Examples from that would be grinding till I paid off my debt or still choosing to get a different degree when the science program was no longer something I wanted to see in my near future. Like the article talks about classroom assessments, I believe that they are very important to best understand how a student learns best which I believe is very important to both me and everyone.
